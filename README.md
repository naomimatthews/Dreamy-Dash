Endless Runner for iOS made in Unity C#

Welcome to the Endless Runner, an exciting endless running game developed in Unity using C# for iOS devices. This project showcases various technical aspects, including ad integration, data persistence using PlayerPrefs, Unity Analytics analytics tracking, and a scriptable object-based shop system. The game's core functionality and a rewards system are already implemented, laying the groundwork for further development and eventual release on the App Store.

## Key Features and Technical Aspects

- **Endless Running Gameplay**: Experience the thrill of an endless runner game with intuitive controls and dynamic obstacles.

- **Ad Integration**: Monetize your game with the inclusion of ads. Advertisements are strategically placed, providing players with engaging experiences while generating revenue.

- **Data Persistence**: Utilizing PlayerPrefs, the game saves player progress, high scores, and other relevant data. Users can resume their game from where they left off even after closing the app.

- **Analytics Tracking**: Unity Analytics is integrated to gather valuable insights into player behaviour and performance. This helps in making data-driven decisions for further improvements.

- **Scriptable Objects for Shop**: The game features a scriptable object-based shop system, allowing easy customization and expansion of in-game items and upgrades. Players can unlock new characters, power-ups, or cosmetic items using in-game currency.

## Rewards System

The game includes a comprehensive rewards system that incentivizes players to achieve milestones, complete challenges, or reach high scores. By collecting rewards, players can unlock exclusive content, access new levels, or gain additional in-game benefits. The foundation for this system is already implemented, providing a solid framework for expanding and refining the rewards system further.

## Future Development and App Store Release

I am actively working on this project to enhance its features, optimize performance, and polish the overall gameplay experience. Planned future updates include:

- Adding new levels, environments, and obstacles to provide players with fresh and engaging content.

- Introducing additional game modes and challenges to cater to different player preferences.

- Refining the rewards system to provide a balanced and rewarding progression curve.

- Enhancing graphics, sound effects, and overall visual appeal.

I plan to release this game on the App Store once it reaches a satisfying level of quality and polish. Stay tuned for updates and follow the progress of this project.
